<div>People Help the People</div>
<div>Birdy</div>
<div>God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts</div>
<div>I guess you kissed the girls and made them cry</div>
<div>Those Hardfaced Queens of misadventure</div>
<div>God knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken eyes</div>
<div>Fiery throng of muted angels</div> 
<div>Giving love but getting nothing back</div>
<div>People help the people</div>
<div>And if your homesick, give me your hand and I'll hold it</div>
<div>People help the people</div>
<div>And nothing will drag you down</div>
<div>Oh and if I had a brain, Oh and if I had a brain</div>
<div>I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool</div>
<div>That turned all those good hearts away</div>
<div>God knows what is hiding in this world of little consequence</div>
<div>Behind the tears, inside the lies</div>
<div>A thousand slowly dying sunsets</div>
<div>God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts</div>
<div>I guess the loneliness came knocking</div>
<div>No one needsâ€¦</div>
